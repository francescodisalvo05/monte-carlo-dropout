# Monte Carlo Dropout
This repository aims to explain and illustrate the Monte Carlo Dropout for evaluating the model uncertainty.
Two blog-posts will be soon available on our platform: stAI tuned.

The first one will cover the Bayesian inference and the Monte Carlo dropout, highlighting pros and cons of both approaches, whereas the second one will explain, step by step, the pipeline of this project.
